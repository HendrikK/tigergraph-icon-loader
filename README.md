# TigerGraph Icon Loader
Tools to transform and load many icons into TigerGraph for use in GraphStudio

# Overview
TigerGraph's GraphStudio has a method to add a single icon at a time using the web interface.
However, if you have a large collection of icons from a specific industry such as healthcare
this method is very time consuming and difficult to reproduce consistently on multiple environments.

# Method
If you have a folder of icons in 512x512 png format you can copy hem into the following folder:

[tigergraph-user-home]/tigergraph/visualization/server/src/public/prod/assets/img/user-uploaded-icons/
